# Compiling

Unfortunately there was not a proper way to handle nms dependencies, and the only way was to manually create a .jar file containing all the nms classes:


You will need to download this file:

and then create a folder named "nmsLib" in the root project folder, and copy that jar into that folder.
Once you have done that, you will be able to compile the project.
